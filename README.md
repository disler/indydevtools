## Usage, maintenance plan, and usage guide of this tool
- IndyDevTools is a suite of tools focused on solving problems using AI agents.
- The each tool, down to the code is designed to be highly modular, and composable, so you can use the tools in combination with each other, or use them on their own to solve specific problems.
- This tool was created to solve problems utilizing agents, and to share ideas, principles, and patterns that can help you thrive in the rapidly expanding age of AI.
- This repo is highly opinionated, as it's a principle driven project designed to solve specific problems that I run into on a consistent basis.
  - If you have a solution to a problem that you think should be included, feel free to crack open a PR.
  - If you see, or think of a tool that's missing that would be beneficial to all users, feel free to crack open an issue.
  - Feel free to fork it and make it your own.

## Tool Overview
- [Youtube Metadata Generation](#ðŸ“¹-multi-agent-youtube-metadata-generation-idt-yt)

## Principles
> Principles drive decisions, decisions drive actions, actions drive results.
> Understanding the principles behind a tool will help you understand how to use it, and how to use it effectively.

### > USE THE RIGHT TOOL (AGENT) FOR THE JOB
- Every tool in this toolbox consists of one or more agents designed to solve a specific set of problems.
- Agent > Code > Manual Input
- `CRUD[:2]` -> Prefer Create, and Read over Update, and Delete when using AI Agents

### > EVERYTHING IS A FUNCTION
- Every tool in this toolbox is a function that takes inputs and returns outputs.
- Every function can be called on it's own in isolation, or used in combination with other functions to create a more complex process.
- By treating every critical unit of code as a function, we can create a library of reusable building blocks that can be used to solve many problems.

### > GREAT QUESTIONS YIELD GREAT ANSWERS
- At the core of every product, there is a question that it attempts to answer.
- The quality of the answer is directly proportional to the quality of the question.
- IndyDevTools attempts to answer the question: **"What's the best way to build multi-agent systems that can solve problems autonomously on my behalf?"**
- The harsh truth is that the answer to your question is buried in questions, experiments, failed attempts, and iterations. IndyDevTools is an ongoing experiment to answer the question of how to build multi-agent systems that can solve problems autonomously on your behalf.

### > CREATE REUSABLE BUILDING BLOCKS
- In the age of AI where code, data, and models are becoming a commodity, the most valuable thing you can create is a reusable building block that can be used to solve many problems.
- Build small, composable, and reusable functions that can be used together, or only one at a time.

### > Prompts (Agents) are THE new fundamental unit of programming
- Just like loops, variables, and functions, we treat prompts as a fundamental unit of programming.
- In the age of AI, prompts are the most powerful way to design, build, and engineer systems that can solve problems autonomously on your behalf.
- They should be treated with the same level of respect (as time goes on, even more) and care as any other fundamental unit of programming.

### ðŸ“¹ Multi Agent Youtube Metadata Generation (`idt yt`)
- This tool generates the metadata for a youtube video.

#### Use case
- You've just finished rendering a video to upload to youtube, and you need to generate the metadata for the video. This tool will help you generate the title, description, tags, and thumbnail for the video.
- It's not meant to be a 100% replacement for your metadata, but it's meant to jump start you to 80% completion.
- The best command to run is `idt yt gen-meta-auto` which will walk you through key steps to generate the metadata for your video. It will
  - Transcribe the video
  - Prompt you for key information like
    - Rough Draft Title
    - SEO Keywords
    - How many iterations of the title, description, and thumbnail you want to generate
  - Generate multiple titles, descriptions, and thumbnails for you to choose from
  - The description will combine the hashtags, references, and the description
  - Generate the final metadata for you to upload to youtube
  - In addition to outputting these assets to the `final/` directory, it will also output the drafts to the `drafts/` directory so you can review them and make any changes if necessary.
- The goal is to make it as easy as possible to generate the metadata for your video, and to make it as easy as possible to make changes to the metadata if necessary.

#### Get Started
1. Install IndyDevTools
    ```bash
    pip install indydevtools
    ```
2. View and initialize the configuration file
    ```bash
    idt yt config
    ```
    - Should print something like
      ```yml
      yt:
        config_file_path: <path to this config file for you to open and edit>
        openai_api_key: <your openai api key will fallback to env var OPENAI_API_KEY>
        operating_dir: <Path to your rendered video/audio, also the output path where the assets that will be generated>
      ```
    - This will create the configuration file if it doesn't exist and the `/drafts` and `/final` directories in the operating directory.
3. Edit the configuration file to add your openai key and path to your audio/video files
4. Run a test command
    ```bash
    idt yt thumb create -p "bird writing code"
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    idt yt titles create -r "Using AI Coding Assistants to code faster than ever"
    ```
5. Make sure the thumbnail was created in the `<config.yt.operating_dir>/drafts` directory
6. Run the full metadata generation command
    ```bash
    idt yt gen-meta-auto
    ```
7. See [Commands](#yt-commands) for more information
