LLM technology is breaking the limits on what you can build. You can now create software that not only makes decisions for you, it can create arbitrary content on your behalf. In this video, I want to give you key engineering principles and techniques to help you build incredible multi-agent systems that solve problems on your behalf. There's one principle in particular that once you know it, will unlock a new world of rapid engineering and productivity gains for you. Senior engineers know this principle intuitively through experience. Not only am I going to share this principle with you to help you architect, design, code, and ship your work faster, I'm going to show you exactly what it looks like in practice to give you a practical reference and guide on how to use this principle in this video. What is this incredible engineering principle that senior plus engineers just kind of know by heart? It's simple. Everything is a function. What does that mean? What are the implications? How does this help you ship code faster? How does it help you build use?
